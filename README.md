# Hello-World-KattCreations-VR
This is my First VR app project for Cardboard
Katarina Nino
It took me a total of 2 hours of work.
One thing I loved about this project was how much control I have on every detail, I had so many ideas I wanted to implement and was a little hindered by my lack of experience with the program, but that only pushed me to learn more.
The hardest part was trying not to break it so much that I had to start from scratch, which I had to do 3 times.
With all of my trials I gained a better understanding of the process and feel very accomplished in my modified demo.
